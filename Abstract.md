# Toward Unified Acceleration in Classical, Quantum, and AI Computation

The approaching limits of classical computing are rendering large-scale scientific simulations and complex engineering computations prohibitively time-consuming. To overcome current computational bottlenecks, next-generation paradigms are essential.

This project explores an integrated approach to accelerate computational workflows using two complementary technologies: Hybrid Classical-Quantum Computing, where quantum algorithms are implemented within the XACC framework to build a practical hybrid workflow, establishing a robust foundation for scalable quantum-accelerated applications despite modest immediate speedups; and AI-based Surrogate Modeling, which involves training AI models to approximate outputs of computationally intensive simulations, enabling near-instantaneous predictions and drastically reducing classical computational demands. By combining these approaches, the project aims to explore the feasibility of a hybrid, heterogeneous computing paradigm, leveraging existing HPC, quantum computing, and AI-driven simulation frameworks for large-scale problems.
