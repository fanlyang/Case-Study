# Toward Unified Acceleration in Classical, Quantum, and AI Computation

Traditional computing power is approaching its limits, making large-scale scientific simulations and complex engineering computations increasingly challenging.To overcome current computational bottlenecks, next-generation paradigms are essential.
This project proposes an integrated approach to accelerate computational workflows using two complementary technologies:
Hybrid Classical-Quantum Computing: Implement quantum algorithms within the XACC framework to build a practical hybrid workflow. While immediate speedups may be modest, this effort establishes a robust foundation for scalable quantum-accelerated applications.
AI-based Surrogate Modeling: Train AI models to approximate outputs of computationally intensive simulations, enabling near-instantaneous predictions and drastically reducing classical computational demands.
By combining these approaches, the project aims to:Bridge Classical and Emerging Paradigms: Connect and leverage existing HPC, quantum computing, and AI-driven simulation frameworks to explore the feasibility of future integration.
