# Toward Unified Acceleration in Classical, Quantum, and AI Computation

The pursuit of computational efficiency is relentless. We constantly aim to compute faster and more accurately. However, 
traditional computing approaches are approaching the limits imposed by Moore’s law. Modern scientific and engineering problems 
often involve extremely large-scale simulations or complex computations, which can be prohibitively time-consuming.
This raises the question: how can we achieve further acceleration beyond classical methods?

In this project,we will use:

1. Hybrid Classical-Quantum Computing: Utilize quantum algorithms within the XACC framework to establish a practical hybrid workflow. Although small problems may not show speedup, the implementation itself is a tangible achievement and provides a foundation for future scalability.

2. AI-based Surrogate Modeling: Train AI models to approximate outputs of highly complex and time-consuming simulations. Once trained, these surrogate models can deliver near-instantaneous solutions.

By combining hybrid quantum computing and AI-based surrogate modeling, this project aims to:

Explore and establish the potential advantages of next-generation computing models.

Achieve significant acceleration in computational workflows for large-scale problems.

Provide a foundation for future research in HPC, quantum computing, and AI-enhanced simulations, bridging classical and emerging computational paradigms.
